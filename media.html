                    <p>The popular notion that legends are made from the battles they have won, holds to be true.
                     Great men like Louis Zamperini and Neil Amstrong have left their footprints on the sands of time because of the challenge they summounted. 
                    However, my story might not find me pull down great walls. Mine may be born out of a mind filled with lofty ambitions, and a heart yearning for greatness.
                    Mine is a story of resilience, fighting the battle of getting up on every fall. Mine is different, it's unique.</p>
                    
                   <p> What characterizes a fulfilling sojourn on earth? To many, it might be the fame or wealth accumulated. I take a very different notion. Infact right from my early days I always knew that I want more than wealth.
                    But what could that be? I found myself beginning my tech journey in 2020 during the Codvid-19 lockdown, through a recommendation from a friend (whom I will forever be grateful). In his words,"Emediong you are the man. I don't think we will see a man more qualified to succeed in tech more than you".
                    I was leaning over the kitchen sink in my parents 2 bedroom apartment, I recall vividly. Till today, I don't think I have ever believed in my tech journey enough, if compared to how Michael did.</p>

                    <p>Starting out like every other popular beginner, with only an Infinix Note 8 smartphone and unquantifiable dreams, I learnt python through Mosh's video. In just two days, I knew that "this is my place, coding". I built a simple bank CLI program using if and else on Pydriod. It felt amazing. This feeling was geniune. Learning Datascience with my phone, the basics of Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. It was so exhilirating.
                    Although I had a couple few years drifting in inconsitencies and distractions, I am here - to make things right.

                    The past for years have thought me many excellent lessons. But one outstanding lesson is that I am here for more. My discovery of tech 4 years ago has been one of the most defining landmarks in my life. I have now realized that GOD has been leading me all along, and with HIM, the world will hear my STORY </p>

            <p>I listen to Jim Rohn alot. One of the things he said was, "The only way it gets better for you is when you get better."</p>

                <h2>Why Altschool</h2>
                <p>The ability to learn is not fixed. You can learn and become the best in a particular area, if only you adopt a growth mindset and put in the effort
                    I believe that I can learn and become of high value in the tech space and life generally. Being in Altschool is very strategic in my entrepreneurial career, as I desire to build great Softwares that will make a difference in the world.
                    I strongly believe that this is the best decision I have made yet
